I am a quality focused software delivery professional with expertise in the area of Development Team and Stakeholder Management. I have significant experience in developing software solutions from an architectural, engineering and quality assurance perspective. I am an advocate of agile and post agile approaches with experience in the design, implementation and execution of various processes and procedures. I believe productive teams need to communicate and collaborate and strive to build relationships and environments to that end.
