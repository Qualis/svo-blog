Mechanism to avoid conflict and ensure appropriate audience is involved in decision making.

## When

Someone requests some action without going through the normal prioritisation process, or if there is anything concerning about the action being requested.

## Why

The request is placing you in the position of both being the decision maker and making the decision in the moment.

## What

The idea here is to avoid saying "no" in the moment. It's not unlike the "turn your tongue seven times before speaking" approach to giving yourself time to think before speaking. A "no" can potentially cause conflict as the action may be of value to the individual.

## How

In this situation you want to `deflect` to another, or potentially just broader audience and `defer` the decision in time e.g. “no problem, but we will likely want to involve Bob and Jane so they are across the change”. In this example you are deflecting the decision at least in part to Bob and Jane. You are also deferring when the decision can be made by requiring Bob and Jane in the decision making process.
